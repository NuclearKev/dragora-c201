# Commentary:
#
# This script will take the hastle out of creating your own kernel to boot on
# the C201. Keep in mind that you will need to modify this script for whatever
# version you wish to use.
#
# NOTE: If you uncomment the last command, make sure you put in the correct
# kernel partition for whatever device you're using.

# Generate the new image
mkimage -D "-I dts -O dtb -p 2048" -f kernel.its kernel.itb

# Sign the new image and apply the necessary parameters
vbutil_kernel --pack newkernel \
							--keyblock kernel.keyblock \
							--version 1 \
							--signprivate kernel_data_key.vbprivk \
							--bootloader config.txt --config config.txt \
							--vmlinuz kernel.itb --arch arm

# Flash to kernel partition
# dd if=newkernel of=/dev/sda1

# Verfify that it's correct
# vbutil_kernel --verify /dev/sda1
