# Installing Dragora 3 on the Asus Chromebook C201
This repo is a guide on how to install Dragora version 3 on the C201
Chromebook. Some of the things require some GNU/Linux know-how but I will
attempt to make it easy to understand. This will not only help you install
Dragora but should also help you boot your own modified version of Linux or
Linux-libre on the C201. That being said, you should be able to boot any
ARM-supported GNU/Linux distribution with the generic parts of the guide.

# Recommendations
Before I start, there are some recommendations I would like to give. I highly
recommend removing the original BIOS, coreboot, with the fully-free
libreboot. This will not only make the system more free but it will actually
boot slightly fast this way. Plus it removes the ChromeOS nonsense at
startup. This is *not* a guide for libreboot; that is
found [here][libreboot-howto].
