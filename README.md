# Installing Dragora 3 on the Asus Chromebook C201
This repo is a guide on how to install Dragora version 3 on the C201
Chromebook. Some of the things require some GNU/Linux know-how but I will
attempt to make it easy to understand. This will not only help you install
Dragora but should also help you boot your own modified version of Linux or
Linux-libre on the C201. That being said, you should be able to boot any
ARM-supported GNU/Linux distribution with the generic parts of the guide.
